# How do we re-use assets?

TEMPLATE EXTENDING

For my sake, I am going to need to display my posts in many different places.

It would be annoying to add the code every time I want to do that.

Instead I can define it one time and re-use that piece of code over and over again.

Really, we are just importing everything around the post list in this example, but, we
will fix this later!
