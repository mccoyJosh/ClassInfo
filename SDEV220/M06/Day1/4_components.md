# Components

So if you are familiar with other programming languages
and their web frameworks, you probably know about components.

Getting and using these external components and adding them to our page is fairly simple.
We just import it just like we do to our css (link in the head).

So if we perhaps want to use the very very famous Bootstrap components within our project, we can
simply put this link in our head of our project:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

This essentially points whoever is trying to visit our website to utilize pre-defined css 
from bootstrap. So, we can start using their tags within our project.

See bootstrap.html for an example.

Visit this website for intro to their components:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/

What this allows us to do is get some nice looking websites in no time
(and without much css on our part).
