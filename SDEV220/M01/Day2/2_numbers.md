# Numbers

We have already briefly talked about numbers in python, specifically integers
and floating point values, and conventionally, they are not hard to understand. 

One is simply whole numbers.

One can hold numbers with decimals (for precision)

So, we are going to move on to how these types are interacted with:

## Operations

- Addition
  ```python
  
  ```
- Subtraction
  ```python
  
  ```
- Multiplication
  ```python
  
  ```
- (Floating Point) Division
  ```python
  
  ```
- Integer (truncating) division
  ```python
  
  ```
- Modulus
  ```python
  
  ```
- Exponent
  ```python
  
  ```

## Precedence


## Bases

- Binary (Base 2)
  ```python
  # Use 0b or 0B before value


  # Convert to binary using bin(<number>)


  ```
- Octal (Base 8)
  ```python
  # Use 0o or 0O before value
  

  # Convert to octal using oct(<number>)

  ```
- Hexadecimal (Base 6)
  ```python
  # Use 0x or 0X before value


  # Convert to hexadecimal using hex(<number>)

  
  ```
