# Variables

Variables are simply aliases for values; perhaps you just need 
this value later, or need to build upon it, you can store it temporarily 
in a variable so you can work on it or work with it.

## Making variables

All you need to do to make a variable is to give it a name and give it a value...
and separate it by a equal sign (=)

```python
variable_name = "value you want the variable to hold"
```
