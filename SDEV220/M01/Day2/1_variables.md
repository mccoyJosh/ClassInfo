# Variables

Variables are simply aliases for values; perhaps you just need 
this value later, or need to build upon it, you can store it temporarily 
in a variable so you can work on it or work with it.

## Making variables

All you need to do to make a variable is to give it a name and give it a value...
and separate it by a equal sign (=)

```python
variable_name = "value you want the variable to hold"
```

## Naming variabes

**Syntax Rules**:

- Can only consist of Lowercase and Uppercase letter, Digits (0 through 9), and Underscores (_)

- They are case-sensitive: thing, Thing, and THING are different names.

- They must begin with a letter or an underscore, not a digit.

- They cannot be one of Pythonâ€™s reserved words (also known as keywords)

- good names according to their purpose
