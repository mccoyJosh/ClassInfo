# GitHub

GitHub is one of many web based services to host remote version control systems, specifically git.
There are other providers which will store your git project, such as BitBucket or Gitlab, but
we will be using GitHub for the project. 

GitHub will host the repo which will act as the remote repository that was talked about in the previous section.

# Projects on Github

GitHub has an easy-to-use project management tool.
I would highly recommend using something like it to plan out your project!

I would also recommend Notion as well!


# Working Collaboratively

- Make repo
- Both individuals pull repo down
- Both make changes and commit and push changes
  - Get other person changes with `git pull`
  - Push changes to repo with `git push`
- BEWARE OF CHANGING THE SAME FILE (could result in merge conflict)
