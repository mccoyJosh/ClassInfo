# Submitting Assignments

For many assignments, you need to do a number of things prior to submitting, so I thought it would be wise to make sure y'all know what to do:

## The Example

> Do 3.1 on [first assignment](https://ivylearn.ivytech.edu/courses/1322697/assignments/21129877?module_item_id=51751605)


- Make jupyter notebook
  - Add header w/ assignment name and developer name
  - Add question
  - Add code/explanation of problem
- When done, download or find jupyter notebook to send up repo.
- Make github repository
  - Add jupyter notebook
  - Push to github
  - MAKE SURE I HAVE ACCESS TO THE REPOSITORY -> mccoyJosh
- Submit link in Canvas





### NOTE: Just like how I am constantly just adding new files and lectures to one repo and referencing back to it, you can also just make one repo and add each assignment to it as the semester goes on. If you do this, make sure either you name the jupyter notebook with the same name as the assignment, or leave the file name somewhere in the submission for the assignment! I just need to know where it is at.

- go through submitting

- Gotta let me have access
- Show how to like add notebook to github repo and then copy GitHub domain to canvas
