# Fun Thing: Design Patterns

# [The book which started it all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)

# See this nice website showing off design patterns [HERE](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog)

Now, design patterns are simply solutions to design problems (within object-oriented programming languages)

There are many, many problems that come up when designing code, and you are likely NOT
the first person to experience this!

A few smart people (the Gang of Four) noticed this and wrote a book of these common design 
patterns and what they solve.

It is KINDA important for you to be aware of their existence, either to help you
out in coding or in pursuing a career (employers probably will be happy to hear you know
design patterns)!

Now, these are not super set-in-stone, like data structures for instance, and instead
are more of general design features, as they can be applied in a more general sense.

Also, before getting into it, these are not things you should be implementing absolutely everywhere, because
maybe it is not a good use case. So, use wisely!

### ALSO, keep in mind, you have probably used some of these before but just didn't have a name for them!

# Types:

Few different types that are outlined in the book!

## Creational Patterns

These designs are different ways of going about creating/instantiating objects

## Structural Patterns

These designs look at how you should be implementing objects and what is in them

## Behavioural Patterns

These designs look at how two objects communicate to one another!

------------------------------

# Example Creational Patterns


## Singleton



## Builder



## Prototype



------------------------------

# Example Structural Patterns


## Adapter



## Composite



## Decorator



------------------------------

# Example Behavioral Patterns


## Iterator



## Observer
