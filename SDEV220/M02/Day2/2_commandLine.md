# Command Line

The command line is exactly what it sounds like... a 
line where you can put commands. These are commands to do things on a machine.
Typically, in your every day life, you do most things from a gui, whether
that be coding, watching videos, and what not. But before proper guis
were implemented, all you had was a command line to work with; simply characters
on a screen. While machines being only command line based is not really a common
thing anymore, the command line itself has a very important spot in your tools as a 
developers. It provides you easy access to running, well, commands, whether that 
be commands like 'python myfile.py' to run python code, or commands for git, it is
a simplistic tool that can do tons for you. 

There are also instances where you NEED to use a command line, for instance, connecting to a system which
only has a command line as part of it (whether that be a database system, device hosting a website, or anything else). Not every machine needs a gui, and having a gui run can often take resources which could be used to run whatever program a machine may be dedicated to, thus, the only access point you 
have to the device is going to be through a commandline.

While there are many commands to use, the most important ones are those that help you 
navigate through the file system (YOUR COMPUTER).

# File System Structure

Before working with the command line, 

- understand file system structure
  - organized as tree structure

We also need to know how to make and edit files too:

## Make Files

Windows
```
type nul > <filename>
```

Mac/Linux
```
touch <filename>
```

## Edit Files

WELL, you might need something for this...

Windows
```
```

Mac/Linux
```
```

## Move Files

Windows
```
move <filepath> <new-filepath>
```

Mac/Linux
```
mv <filepath> <new-filepath>
```


# Copy Files

Windows
```
copy <filepath> <filepath-to-copy-location>
```

Mac/Linux
```
cp <filepath> <filepath-to-copy-location>
```

# Using a terminal in IDE

There are terminal tools in (most likely) any IDE you use.

In VSCode:

In Pycharm:
