# Function (reminder)

When doing anything, it is annoying to do something twice.
Now, specifically for coding, we do already have a solution for this: loops!
Loops allow us to iterate through a problem as many times as we need to.

Problem is, any time there is some sort of change to said problem, or if
we need to code a solution to a technical problem that is required to be found in multiple
locations in our code, loops are not going to cut it.

For this sake, we have functions: repeated chunks of code which can fit different problem sets (when we use
different input parameters).

# Functions in general



# Functions in Python


# Parameters


## Default Parameters


# Recursive Functions

- note their usefulness in tree objects (which we will get to the next day)
