# Objects and classes, what are they, generally?

Classes and Objects are often used interchangeably in software development because they
are basically the same thing.

To be clear though, technically, they aren't.

A class is a definition for how a thing operates and what variables it holds.

An object is an instance of said class.

For example, if we make a class which holds a single number, the instance of the class (the object) will
actually have an assigned value to that number.

ADD HOW TO MAKE CLASS Aaaaaaaaaahhahahahahahahhah

# Common Things For Classes

Most programming languages have support for making classes and objects by extension, and languages that do this are considered
"object-oriented programming" languages (OOP).

Some similar things you see between these languages are as follows:

### A constructor:
> this is a method which is called to create an instance of a class and define exactly how it is initialized


TODO: add example

### Class Variables:
> these are variables which are available anywhere within the given class (and outside the class if you so choose)

TODO: add example

### Methods: 
> these are functions which exist inside of the class and can be used inside the class (and outside the class if you so choose

TODO: add example

# Common Methods

# Getters and Setter
