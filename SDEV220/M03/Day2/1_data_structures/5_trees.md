# Trees

Trees are bit more complicated of a data structure, but is based off the same idea as the previous data structures: dynamic nodes which point to the next nodes.

Although, tree nodes are special in a few ways, as in one way, that being they have more than one pointer.

Now there is no limit to how many pointers a tree node can have, so one could make a node with 100 pointer nodes, or just 2, but
both would still be a tree.

Another feature of a tree data structure is that they all begin from 1 node and spread out.
Just like the linked list required a head node for us to start at to then navigate to the
rest of the linked list, we have the same thing for trees; we call this node the 'root'

## THIS IS JUST LIKE HOW THE FILES ON YOUR COMPUTER ARE ORGANIZED! INSTEAD OF NODES, WE CALL THEM FOLDERS/DIRECTORIES

# Children Nodes

> the nodes being pointed to from another node.

# Leaf Node

> a node with no children

# Tree Height

> number of nodes from the root node to the farthest leaf node

# Subtrees

> the collection of nodes underneath the current node one would be looking at. Said tree's root would be the node being pointed to
 

An important and probably the most used type of tree is the 'binary search tree'
