# Data Structures

How we store data can be very important. 
When discussing data structures, it refers to how we place variables and values in memory
and their relationship to each other.

We have already seen a number of built-in ways to store data
in python, those being:

- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Sets

Hopefully you already realize the different use cases for these!

If you have a constant, unchanging number of items that you need to access through an index, use a tuple.

If you need to access things via index and need to grow in size, you would want to use a list.

If you have unique variables which have paired values to them, use a dictionary.

Technically, you could use any of these for any of the other's purposes, but, it would make your code slower, which
really gets the reason to be interested in data structures... GREATER EFFICIENCY

In python, much of the inner workings of these data structures are obfuscated from us as they are created for us already.

To get a better understanding of how these variables store data, lets look at a easy example that is fundamental
in most other languages: an array
