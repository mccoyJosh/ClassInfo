# Numbering system

When first learning math, we typically start out by counting using our fingers, which end up being 10 (for most people).
What is helpful is that we also only have 10 digits in our numbering system:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

This makes learning these numbers easier than it might have been. This set of 10 digits is known 
as the BASE 10 numbering system, and it is the one you are (probably) most familiar with.

## This is the DECIMAL numbering system

Although this is common for us in the United States, it is absolutely not the only
way to count numbers. There is the base 12 counting system, which rely on counting
the 12 joints in your fingers (not including the thumb) and this
way of counting helps line up with other natual phenomenon like the lunar cycles.

For these other types of counting systems, there is typically a character to represent the values being counted by,
like how we have 10 digits to represent the 10 numbers we are counting by.

Now, when beginning to understand computers understanding binary is super important as
this is the underlying idea that computer depend on. We will talk more about why this
is the case wednesday, but we are simply going to look at the different numbering systems today to
prepare for this!
