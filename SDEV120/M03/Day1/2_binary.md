# Binary (BASE 2)

So, the fundamental numbering system for computing logic is the base 2 numbering system.
This is because in the real world, an easy way to story and manipulate data
is by have things be ON and OFF, that is, 1 and 0.

Now since Binary is a base 2 numbering system, this means that there is only 2 digits, that
being 0 and 1.
