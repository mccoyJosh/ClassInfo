# Measuring Storage

These 0's and 1's that make up it's internal system store everything on the computer. These are the BITS and BYTES of the
computer.

# Bit

A **BIT** is ```a binary digit; a unit of storage equal to one-eighth of a byte.```

These are what we have been working with. A single 0 or 1 represents this binary value.
With bits, there are not many things we can represent (other than true or false).
So, we instead use a combination of these as larger sets to represent things.

# Nibble

A **NIBBLE** is ```half a byte or four bits.```


# Bytes

A **BYTE** is ```8 bits```.




# Larger Storage
