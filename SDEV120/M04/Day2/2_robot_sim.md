# Robot Simulation

## AKA [Rocksi](https://rocksi.net/)

This week, you are going to have an assignment to use a robot arm
and provide it some simple code to pick up a block.

We are going to look at it briefly to see how it works
so the assignment is not crazy difficult!

## There is a link to the website in the assignment, but if you can't find it, then it is rocksi.net


You are going to be met with a similar screen to the arduino lab we worked with
in the class: CODE ON THE LEFT, simulation on the right.

To run the code in the simulation, there is the big play button within the simulation.

## Code Blocks

A huge different with the code we have here is that is uses blocks of code and NOT written code.

A number of the blocks give you the option to type in values, but you are mostly going to be dragging and dropping
the blocks to create the actions with the arm. 

Some block-based programs allow you to also type in code, but this one does not!

## Example

To start off, you don't even need to worry about trying to copy some sort of starter code and hope it works:
there is a large button called "Examples" which places an example piece of code into the program
for you.

With this example we can see the main features of this simulation:

- move arm
- set blocks
- move blocks

That is really the whole point of this simulation.
