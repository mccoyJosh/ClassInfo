# Network Addresses

Computers can do a whole lot on their own.
Although, what is super important is connecting a computer to another computer.
Connecting a computer to another is known as "networking".

This obviously is essential for our world today, because this is
the basis for the internet. When you connect to a website,
or literally anything, it is through the network
and uses networking tools.

So, how does one connect a computer to another?

Well, it works a lot like mail!

When you want to send a piece of mail, you need
to first "write it", and then send the packet/package/message/letter
to the ADDRESS.

When we want to communicate to another computer, we just need to know "where it is"
on the network/internet!

# IP Addresses

An IP Address is just that!

IP (aka Internet Protocol) Address is a number which is assigned to every 
device connected to a computer network (which uses IP Addressing).

When you want to send a message or communicate to another device, you address
them to the IP address.

## IPV4


subnet mask?

## IPV6


What we see is that your device will have multiple IP Address, 
but of different types!


# Why do we have both

# NAT (Network Address Translation)


# Ports


# Mac Address
