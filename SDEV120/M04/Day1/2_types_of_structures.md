# Basic Types of Structures

> **Structure:** a basic unit of programming logic; each structure is a sequence, selection, or loop.

In the most general sense, algorithms can be organized into
3 main structures:

- sequence
- selection
- loop

In the mid 1960s, mathematicians proved any program
can be made using just these 3 structures.
