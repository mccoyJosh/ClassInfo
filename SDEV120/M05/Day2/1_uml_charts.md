# UML Charts

Unified Modeling Langauge charts aim to establish a standard approach for depicting the design of a system, 
akin to the blueprints used in various engineering fields. UML diagrams are utilized to 
visually illustrate the workings of a system, aiding software engineers, business 
professionals, and system architects in modeling, designing, and analyzing systems.


# Parts of UML Diagrams

## Actor

Within a uml chart, actors represent entites that interact with your system.
This can be users, testers, other systems, devices, or anything else. 
These are the individuals providing **inputs** and receiving the **outputs** 
from the system.


## UseCase

Use Case show specific functions of a system. This is normally equivalent to either
modules, or "greater" purposes. Maybe this would be a larger system with many
inner modules all being part of it.

This should normally be bigger ideas, such as a "Submit Order" function

## System

When describing these smaller functions, they are all typiocally part of larger ideas or 
systems. These should all be bounded together within the parameters of a System Boundary
and labeled accordingly. Typically depicted by a rectangular shape encompassing all system use cases,
the system boundary helps define the system's scope and limitations.

# Class Diagram

Per canvas
> The most commonly utilized UML diagram in software development is the class diagram,
> which serves as the foundation for all object-oriented systems. Class diagrams 
> are used to visually represent the static structure of a system, illustrating the 
> classes, methods, and attributes within the system. Additionally, they aid in 
> identifying relationships between various classes or objects.


# Composite Structure Diagram

Per canvas
> We utilize composite structure diagrams to visually illustrate the internal structure of 
> a class and its interactions with other components within the system. These diagrams 
> represent the relationships between parts and their configurations, showcasing how the 
> classifier (such as a class, component, or deployment node) functions within the system.

# Object Diagram

Per canvas
> An Object Diagram is a visual representation of the instances in a system and the 
> relationships between them. Object diagrams provide insight into the behavior of a 
> system at a specific moment, as they illustrate the behavior of instantiated objects.

# Component Diagram

Per canvas
> Component diagrams are utilized to illustrate the organization of physical components 
> within a system. They are utilized for modeling implementation specifics. These diagrams 
> depict the structural relationship between elements of a software system and aid in 
> determining if planned development adequately addresses functional requirements.

# Deployment Diagram

Per canvas
> Deployment diagrams are utilized to depict the system hardware and software. They 
> provide insight into the hardware components present and the software components that 
> are operational on them. These diagrams showcase the system architecture by illustrating 
> the distribution of software artifacts across multiple targets.

# Package Diagram

Per canvas
> We utilize Package Diagrams to illustrate the organization of packages and their 
> components. A package diagram visually represents the relationships between various 
> packages and the internal structure of packages. Packages aid in organizing UML diagrams 
> into coherent groups, thereby enhancing the clarity and comprehension of the diagram. 
> They are commonly employed in organizing Class and Use case diagrams.

# State Machine Diagrams

Per canvas
> A state diagram is utilized to depict the current state of the system or a specific 
> component of the system at distinct points in time. This type of diagram is considered a 
> behavioral representation, showcasing behavior through finite state transitions. While 
> the terms may be used interchangeably, a state diagram is primarily utilized to outline > the dynamic behavior of a class in reaction to time and external influences.

# Activity Diagrams

Per canvas
> Activity Diagrams are utilized to visually represent the flow of control within a  
> system, including outlining the steps involved in executing a use case. These diagrams  
> are used to model both sequential and concurrent activities within a process.  
> Essentially, they depict workflows in a visual format, focusing on the condition of  
> flow and the specific sequence in which activities occur.

# Use Case Diagrams

Per canvas
> Use Case Diagrams are utilized to visually represent the functionality of a system or  
> specific components within a system. They are commonly employed to demonstrate the  
> functional requirements of the system and how it interacts with external agents, also  
> known as actors. A use case diagram portrays various scenarios in which the system may  
> be utilized. By providing a broad overview, a use case diagram showcases the  
> capabilities and actions of the system without delving into specific implementation  
> details.

# Sequence Diagram

Per canvas
> A sequence diagram depicts the interactions among entities in a system.step-by-step  
> manner, showcasing the order in which these interactions occur. It is also referred to  
> as an event diagram or event scenario. These diagrams are commonly utilized by  
> professionals in business and software development to document and comprehend the  
> requirements for both new and current systems.

# Communication Diagram

Per canvas
> A Communication Diagram, previously known as a Collaboration Diagram in UML 1.x, is  
> utilized to illustrate the sequential exchange of messages between objects. Although  
> similar information can be represented using Sequence diagrams, Communication Diagrams  
> present objects and connections in a more flexible layout.

# Timing Diagram

Per canvas
> Timing Diagrams are a specialized version of Sequence diagrams that depict the behavior  
> of objects over a specific time period. They are useful for showing timing constraints  
> that dictate changes in the states and behavior of objects.

# Interaction Overview Diagram

Per canvas
> An Interaction Overview Diagram represents a series of actions in a simplified manner,  
> breaking down complex interactions into more manageable occurrences. It combines  
> elements of activity and sequence diagrams to streamline the depiction of interactions.
