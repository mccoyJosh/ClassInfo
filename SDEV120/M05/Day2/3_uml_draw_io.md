# UML within DRAW IO

So, we have been using draw.io up to this point
to draw, create, and plan out pieces of code
with flow charts.

draw.io has many more options though! There are 
extensions for electronical components, and many many
other things you may need to, well, draw (or diagram).

It also has the tools needed to diagram out UML charts!

-------

- do that

- also do lots of examples
