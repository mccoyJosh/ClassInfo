# Math

Honestly, many of these concepts are going to be
review, but many parts of the IT field and especially
coding is very much math based. So, we are going to
cover just the basics of some math formulas:

# Data Set Calculation (Statistics)

Much of what programs do is deal with calculating statistics.

We have lots of data in the world to go through, and having computers do it is very important.

So, before we get into coding these type of problems (which
typically deal with arrays and lists of sorts), we should understand how these calculations work!

## Minimum

## Maximum

## Sum

## Count (?)

## Mean


## Median

## Mode

## Range

## Variance (?)

## Standard Deviation



-------
# Others

## Converting between Celcius and Fahrenheit

- F -> C
- C -> F

show if you just know one of them,
you can find the other


## Converting units

maybe do something like inches to cm
