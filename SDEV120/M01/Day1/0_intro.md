# Welcome to the class

Welcome to SDEV 120! We will learn the fundamentals of computers in this course
so hopefully you get a feel and understanding on how these *generally* work.

In this class, we really do not get into "coding" per se, but see how one should
go about writing good code.

# Basic Stuff

This info is literally in the beginning of almost all computer courses, so this
is not going to be the first time this will be drilled into ya head:


> **Computer System:** A combination of all the components required to process and store data and using a computer, which is composed of multiple pieces of hardware and software

## Hardware v. Software

> *Hardware* is the physical equipment and devices that make up one's computer. This is the
> keyboard, mouse, speakers, printers, mic, camera, RAM, CPU, storage and all the internal 
> bits in a computer.

> *Software* is what is __on__ the hardware; to be more specific: it is the
> instructions on these devices and systems which tell the device/system how to
> operate.


These instructions to make the computer do *something* is called a __program__.

If you write these instructions, these programs, you are __programming__ and doing the tasks of a __programmer__.

These programs often need to be carried out in a specific manner or set 
of instructions to actually produce a desired solution... 
this set of instructions would be the __logic__ of a program.

MUCH of this class if simply focused on *logically* solving problems.

## How do we get software to tell the computer how to do... well... anything

(generally, obviously elaborate)
COMPUTER <--- MACHINE CODE <---- ASSEMBLY CODE (low level lang) <---- HIGH LEVEL CODE 


## Compilers and Interpreters and Binary

Basically, we do NOT want to be manually writing 0's and 1's, so
we make the computer translate human readable stuff to less human readable stuff
