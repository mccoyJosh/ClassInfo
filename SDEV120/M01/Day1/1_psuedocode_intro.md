# Psuedocode Introduction

Before we can really talk about psuedocode specifically, we
need to discuss code more generally.

Put simply: *code* (aka an *algorithm)* is __set of instructions to complete a task__.

This definition is broad enough to not limit itself to only computer code.
Any set of instructions to do *anything* is a type of code or algorithm.

The class example of a piece of 'code' in the real world is a cooking recipe.
Recipes are typically instructions to complete the task of making some type of
food, and looking at one can help us actually see the many aspects of a real
piece of code... so let's look at a *simplified* recipe:

```
# To Bake A Cake
1. preheat oven to 320Â°F
2. get mixing bowl
3. add flour and baking powder to mixing bowl
4. sift flour and baking powder together
5. mix in sugar, butter, milk, and vanilla
6. get cake tin
7. grease cake tin
8. pour mixture into cake tin
9. put cake bin into oven
10. allow cake to bake for 45-50 minutes
11. remove cake from oven
12. let cool
13. EAT
```

With just this example, we can see many of the basics of all programs/code/algorithms.

# It works!

Obviously, the first thing we notice is that if we follow this algorithm,
we will end up with the desired result... a cake!

The idea you should understand from this is that a piece of code
should complete a task/series of task. If a piece of code is not doing
the desired task, you have an issue (obviously).

If something is preventing us from completing the task, whether that be
an issue with the written instructions, or the correct instructions being unable to
be followed for some reason, this is known as an __error__ or a __bug__.

There are many ways a piece of code can have an error.
