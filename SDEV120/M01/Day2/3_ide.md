# Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

## What is it


## What kinds of things do they provide


## Is it necessary

Technically, NO, but if you code professionally, you will be expected to know how to properly use one.

You could do everything you need from a simple text editor, but an IDE will provide immense help in actually 
writing your code as all the tools you will need will be in a GUI application.
