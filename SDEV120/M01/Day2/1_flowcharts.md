# Ending Programs

- No more lines to run (ends "naturally")
- If it is a loop, it will run forever without us preventing it

> We can use a **_sentinel value_** to end a program if it is running forever!

When we refer to the end of a file, we can use the initials "eof" to represent it (standing for "**E**nd **O**f **F**ile")
