# Types of programming "generally" used today


# Procedural programming

## Formal Definition:
> **_Procedural programming_**: a programming technique that focuses on procedures or actions. Contrast with object-oriented programming.

This type of programming is simply making small portions of code that do specific task.
You then combine these small pieces into whatever larger task you need done.

This is a more "traditional" way to approach programming.


# Object Oriented Programming

## Formal Definition:
> **_Object Oriented Programming (OOP)_**: a programming model that focuses on components and data items (objects) and describes their attributes and behaviors. Contrast with procedural programming.

Instead of breaking problems down into smaller "solutions",
we instead take our problems and represent them as objects, which often contain code
to solve them. The idea is that we can iterate upon objects and make them "extend" into other objects, 
a concept known as "inheritance". This ends up saving us time in re-writing the same code.

You can do both of these with many programming languages, but most
programming languages are typically built around following one of these paradigms

# GUI environment vs command-line environment

So really simple programs we have seen here already, that being ones which run on a command line.

Commandline programs are the ones which are purely text based and which allow us
to test things out logic wise... unless you intend on your final project to also be command line based.

GUI applications have a window/page of buttons and pictures and many, many thing. This is most applications
you deal with on a day-to-day basis.

> Regardless of whether it is a GUI program or command-line program,
> if they are made to do the same task, the logical process behind the scenes will be the same.
