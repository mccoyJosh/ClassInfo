# Sorting Data
We have previously discussed sorting data already.
We are going to properly look at the bubble sort algorithm. 
It is pretty simple compared to other ones.

The bubble sort algoritm relies on SWAPPING.

SWAPPING is the act of replacing the 2 variables with the other one's values, i.e. swapping their values.

Since we don't want to create a whole new array for sorting, we just swap the values currently existing in our array


### BRIEFLY show how to swap

```not_python
def swap(*int var1, *int var2):
    int temp = *var1
    *var1 = *var2
    *var2 = *var1 
```
