# Loop syntax in python

# While Loop

- show off simple loop (count controlled loop)
- show off indefinite loop


# For Loop

In python, for loops do not work exactly like we have seen on monday.
They CAN work in the same way using range, but really it just iterates through things

- for loops with range
  - normal (100)
  - custom range (10, 20)
  - change increment (10, 20, 2)
    - show negative increment
- show off it walking through strings



# Arrays (to make your list of numbers) 

So, the way we explained arrays earlier is how arrays work in MOST
programming languages.
Some of these rules are NOT the same in python!

Here is how you do it:

- show off list
  - mutable
  - CAN increase size of list... so not really an array
  - does allow multiple types, so, again, different
  - initialized and accessed the same tho


# For Loops with Arrays

- show off for loop walking through each value in array
- maybe do example adding up each value
- maybe do example looking for a specific value
- walk through loop determining if each value meets some sort of qualification, perhaps being POSITIVE/NEGATIVE
