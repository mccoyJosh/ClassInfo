# MARKDOWN

Markdown is a plain-text based formatting syntax. It is automatically interpreted
by many systems to display whatever info you need in a readable fashion.
For instance, GitHub and JetBrain products have built-in interpreters of markdown files.
A lot of the files I've used for these lecture notes have been in markdown.
