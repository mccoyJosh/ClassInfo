# Debugger
 
The purpose of a debugger is to find and fix bugs.
Debuggers work by walking through a given code and 
showing you every detail during the process.
This includes all the variables that is within the current scope.
What the debugger really saves you from is trying to mentally walk 
through code trying to remember what variable is what, as you can 
just be told what it is
