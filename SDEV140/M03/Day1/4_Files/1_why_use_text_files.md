# Text Files

## Why use files instead of just input/output

- **Unlike intput and output, files actually stick around**
- Files actually stick around on a computer to use for later
- Also, files can hold much more data
- Files can be read and be used as input much faster than typing it in each time (as a user)
- The same data be used for different programs
