## Version Control System

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a type of version control system.

A version control system (VCS), in short, is a type of software which 
manages changes to files.

Typically, a VCS needs a **Repository** to function. This is a folder (or directory)
where all the files of a project are located. This directory acts as the working directory
of the VCS. Everything (unless they are excluded specifically) in the folder will be subject to the
VCS's versioning.

The VCS will keep track of every file and how it has been changed/updated/added/deleted
throughout the timeline of a project's history. This is NOT done automatically
(IN MOST CASES) and instead occurs when the developer 'commits' changes to the timeline. 
With a history of all the changes made to a project, it is inherently versioning the project,
with every addition to the project being a new version. Most VCS will allow users 
to go back through these changes and revert their code to an earlier version if need be.

Typically, VSC will have some way for multiple users to all pull the project on their personal computers 
and work collaboratively on it. 
Typically, it will have some way to allow users to work on
a specific part and then add their part to the main code (BRANCHING).


## Git

Git is an open source version control system which the majority (>90%) of developers/companies
utilize for software projects. 
There are other VCS, such as Apache Subversion (SVN), Concurrent Versions System (CVS) and Mercurial.
We will be using Git for the sake of this class though.
