# README

Nearly every project you will see will have some sort of README file.
This file should explain:

- What project is
- How to install/run project
- How to operate project

The README also can contain a ton of other useful information!
Check out this python gui project's README:
https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI

For the sake of the project, I will require that your README file use markdown
