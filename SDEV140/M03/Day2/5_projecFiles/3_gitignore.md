# .gitignore

Now, you **DO NOT** want to commit & push everything from your project to a remote repo.
This is either because it is information you don't want other individuals knowing, or it
is generated files that the project will create for an individual's machine.
This can include:

- Access Tokens
- Compiled Code
- Project Folders
- OS Specific files (.DS_STORE)
- IDE Specific Information

To avoid adding and committing these files, use  a .gitignore file in the same directory as
your .git folder. The .gitignore file should contain the file paths to the files
you would not like added to a project
