# Social and Ethical Issues

First note:

# <p style="text-align: center;color:red">DON'T BE EVIL</p>

Now, seriously, there is a right and wrong way to act, especially in a professional 
setting like software development. Now, there are many ways you can act that may be legal,
but may be just bad. Most people would consider this "common sense",
but it is sometimes a good idea to make sure we are all on the same page about
what is ethical or not.

So, something to look at is the

### ACM Code of Ethics
https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics

Now, this list is long and we are not going to go through the entirety of it.
But there are a few things we can learn from it.

### IEEE Code of Ethics

https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8

Here is another set of ethics to follow!

## Let's say we are shipping Out Code before it is done

- Think of AAA Game Studios who are constantly releasing unfinished games
  - Pros and cons of hey, people are going to be mad about the game, BUT, maybe the studio needs funding to finish the game and releasing the game early would allow that.
  - Comes down to being honest and open concerning development. Like, people would not be as mad if the game released early if it was not full price and if it was explicitly said it was not finished.

Now, fortunatley, the ACM ethics page agrees with us here.
See: 1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.

## Let's say we are a social media company, and we want to advertise and/or sell you data

- We could sell our users data to advertisers so appropriate products get in front of the correct audience
  - This is legal
  - This is done all the time
  - But, does that mean it is ethical.... probably not
  - There is the argument that hey, social media services are often free and THEY HAVE TO MAKE MONEY SOME HOW
  - But it doesn't necessarily need to be targeted advertising. And more importantly, it is probably more ethical
    if you tell the users exactly how their data is used. 
  - Google
    - If you go on your Google account right now, they will tell you where your data is sent in very vague terms, which seems alright at first, but they MAY not be telling the whole truth
    - For instance, they DID keep data from Incognito tabs, despite saying they didn't https://bgr.com/tech/google-will-destroy-browsing-data-collected-from-chromes-incognito-mode/
    - Also, despite saying they didn't sell your data, they do. In the article, they explain how, technically, Google is saying they are not selling it, but they do kinda facilitate the process in which results in it being sold https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/google-says-it-doesnt-sell-your-data-heres-how-company-shares-monetizes-and
- These actions may be ethically dubious, and the ACM looks like they agree! 1.6 Respect privacy.

## Let's say you are working for a manufacturing company and developing code to streamline some process
- Let's say the code it so good that it would nullify the jobs of 10 men
  - PROS:
    - THIS IS GREAT NEW FOR THE COMPANY! (They can do the same job(s) for significantly less money)
    - You would probably get a raise
    - It would technically save those 10 men from working as hard
- CONS:
  - 10 people may lose their jobs

What is the correct thing to do? It was quite literally your job to write this code. You can't just not release it, as it is probably now
property of the company anyway.

Well, there are a few options depending on the company.
- (Probably Best Option) Retraining/Reskilling
  - The company still has 10 men they probably trust to do a good job. If the company has the funds, they could train them for a different job within the company.
- Helping these employees get new jobs
- Generous Severance Packages

This is very much dependent on the company you work for... honestly, I don't know what you as a individual could necessarily do in this situation.
Hopefully you aren't in this situation :)

## Let's say someone tells you they are breaking a law
- Probably should be a whistle-blower, obviously. Literally not much else can even be said.
