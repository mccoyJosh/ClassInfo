# GitHub

GitHub is one of many web based services to host remote version control systems, specifically git.
There are other providers which will store you git project, such as BitBucket or Gitlab, but
we will be using GitHub for the project. 

GitHub will host the repo which will act as the remote repository that was talked about in the previous section.
