# Data modeling

So we have seen in-depth the Individual object being described, but for the sake
of understanding objects, we are going over some data modeling.

This is really where classes and OOP really shines. Classes, the variables they hold and the methods
they run, can represent real life data/things and it can allow us to make programs that solve
real world problems.
