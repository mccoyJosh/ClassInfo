# Long Term Storage Intro

Up to this point in the class, we have used plenty of data in our programs.
We have talked about how some variables stick around for just the lifetime of a method,
and some stick around for the lifetime of an object, and some stick around for the entirety 
of the program.

Sometimes we want data to stick around longer than our programs. In that case, we need to write it
somewhere.

In this class, we have read and written to files, which is a valid way to store data. 

As long as your computer doesn't just stop existing, files on your device can maintain data
on them as long as you need.

The problem really comes in with how we ought to interpret the data on said files.

If we just need to store text, typically, we  can just use a file with our text written on it.
This kind of file is denoted using a .txt at the end of its name.

Now, sometimes, we need to save more complicated of objects than text, such as objects that represent
a class. For information like this, we may need more complicated ways to store data.

Well, good thing we have those!
