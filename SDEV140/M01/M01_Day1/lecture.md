#### **Algorithms**

Def: _A finite sequence of instructions that, when applied to a problem, will solve it_

- Not a computer-only type problem. A person doing a step by step task is an example of an algorithm
- Really any type of step-by-step process is an algorithm
- **Computing Agent**: the one performing the algorithm
  - Typically, the computing agent is the computer running your algorithm. But, if you are performing some set of tasks, you would be considered a computing agent

### **Typical processing of algorithms**

- takes input
- transforms the information according to wel-defined rules
- produces output

- **EXAMPLES**
  - thinking about this as a person
    - cooks food: input is raw ingredients -> utilize cooking recipe to transform food -> output is yummy food :)
  - thinking about this as computers
    - login page: input is your username and password -> computer validates it -> output is entry into website

#### Hardware VS Software

Hardware:
- the physical devices required to execute algorithms

Software:
- the set of algorithms, represented as programing in particular programming languages

Some main parts of a computer:
- Input/Output Devices
  - Mice, Screens, Keyboards, Headphones
- CPU
  - "A major hardware component that consists of the arithmetic/logic unit and the control unit"
- Memory
  - "The ordered sequence of storage cells that can be accessed by address. Instructions and variables of an executing program are temporarily held"

### Bits, Bytes and what-nots:

- Inside computers are billions maybe trillions of what are known as binary switches, having two modes, being on or off. Being on is typically just when electricity is being passed through them, and off is when it doesn't
- Computers store information on these components as binary values (1's and 0's). Think of 0s as being off, and 1s as being on.
- As far as the computer is concerned, all it "knows" are these 0s and 1s (**bits**)

- now, typically, we want to be able to store more than 0s and 1s. So, what we do is string along a few bits together to form bytes.
- Byte: 8 bits
  - Examples: 
    - 00000000
    - 01010101

With arrangements like these, we can start holding BIG NUMBERS (atleast bigger than 0 and 1).
For instance, the computer can interpret 
- (binary) 00000010 as (decimal) 2 
- (binary) 0000011 as (decimal) 3.

With one byte, we can hold only values from 
- 0 (with the binary being 00000000) to
- 255 (with the binary being 11111111)

Now, obviously we need to be able to work with more than 256 numbers. 
hat why modern computers often use 64 bit based systems. This gives the possibility of holding
numbers as large as 1.84467 * 10^19.

Now for things that are not numbers, we often just store them as numbers and convert them to our needed us case when the time comes. 
For instance, letters (and symbols).

In ASCII, we assign each symbol a number, and just store the number. When we want to display a previously stored message,
we have the computer reads these numbers, convert them to symbols that it displays for us.

This is an example of encoding: "converting data from one form into a proper form required for a certain process"

### Software

When you run something on your device, whether that be the web browser to access this class or some type of video game, all the computer
knows it is doing is processing a very long string of 0's and 1's. These strings of 1s and 0s that the computer execute is known as **_machine code_**.

Now, obviously, in this class we are not about to write millions upon millions of 0s and 1s to attempt to tell the computer what to do.

We like, code and stuff ye

#### Application Software Vs System Software


----

- High Level Programming Languages 
  - Example interpreter vs compiler using C++ and Python
    - General difference discussed between compiler and interpreter
      - Interpreter runs code slower than compiled code
      - Debugging is possible before code is ran with a compiler
      - Compilation may take more time than interpreted code, especially for large code bases
      - Interpreter DOES NOT SAVE the machine code (runs on the fly and doesnâ€™t keep it around)
- Skip history part (READ ON OWN TIME PLEASE)
- Intro to python
  - Installation
  - Hello World In IDLE
  - IDE's
    - IDLE
    - Visual Studio Code
    - Pycharm
    - MORE
  - Where things are stored!!!!!! 
  - Simple code (BACK TO SLIDE SHOW)
