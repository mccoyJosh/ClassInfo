# Code Generators

There is a discussion post this first week.

It is mostly about introducing yourself to the class, but also it is about
utilizing code generators in general.

Code generation tools, like many AI chatbots, are tools at the end of the day.
But, these tools are trained on someone else's data, so whenever you
use one for, I don't know, assignments, there is a small risk of plagiarism technically.

This is obviously a concern in it of itself, but there is also the
problem where, you need to write and run code, and if you have an AI
tool write it for you, how will you learn how to work through
problems yourself!

So, use these tools sparingly and don't ruin your moment
to learn new things!

We will discuss AI later down the line!
