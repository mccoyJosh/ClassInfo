### ***Waterfall***

As we go down the waterfall, the cost of correcting is increasing down each step. For example, it
is going to cost more to fix something when we are in the maintenance phase when compared to the cost of fixing
a mistake while we are in the design phase. 

>THIS IS WHY IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THROUGH PLANNING AS TO FIX AS MANY MISTAKES AS YOU CAN IN EARLY STAGES.

## ***Types***

### **Literal Types**
- Types represent the different kinds of data that the computer can understand and manipulate. These types define how data is stored in memory and what operations can be performed on it. In essence, types in Python are classifications that specify the nature of data objects, enabling the computer to interpret and process them accurately. They provide a structured framework for organizing and working with data in programs.
- None
- Boolean
- Integer
  - Hexadecimal, Binary values
- Float
