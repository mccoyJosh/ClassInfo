# Comments

Here is example of a single line comment:

```python
# Wowee this is a comment (uses a single hashtag character)
```

```python
'''
Here is an example of
a
multiline
comment
'''


"""
Technically,
this is just a string,
but python does nothing with the result of
so it can act as a comment
"""


g = 9.8  # assigning g to 9.8  <---- THIS GIVES NO NEW INFORMATION

g = 9.8   # defining the constant for gravity
```

IF there is a complicated process occurring, use a comment to describe what is going on!
You don't want to forget what code does


# How Often Should you comment

- Every File (at the top)
  - Name Of File
  - Who wrote it
  - What does it do
- Every Function
- Particular Confusing Parts
- If Code Gets Long, Use Comments to break apart and explain sections

You really DO NOT need to comment every line
