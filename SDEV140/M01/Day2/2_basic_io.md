# The Very Basics: Input Output

Nearly every program we write will look like this format:

- input
- proces
- output

Whether that be a website, a calculator, or a game, so much can be summarized by these steps.

So, how do we do them in python?


## Output.... print()

```python
print("hello")
```

## Input....  input()

```python
age = input()
```

You can also put a string within a pair of quotation marks to provide the user a **prompt**!

```python
age = input("Please input your age:")
```
