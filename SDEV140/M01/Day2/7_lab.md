## Fix Error (Syntax)


```python
print("I am going to do some math")

print("Here is 1 + 1: " 1 + 1)

```

Problem: should have a comma after this string duh


## Fix Error (Runtime)


```python
print("I am going to do some math")

print("Here is 1 + 1: ", 1/0 + '1')

```

Problem: shouldn't be adding an integer with a string, and erm don't divide by 0

## Fix Error (Logic)


```python
print("I am going to do some math")

print("Here is 1 + 1: ", '1' + '1')


```

Problem: probably didn't mean to add two strings
