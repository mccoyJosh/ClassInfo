# Errors

## Syntax Errors

- you are not following the rules of the language
- often results in the program not running and stopping

## Logical Errors

- you are not following correct logic to solve a program
- often gets the program to the end of the code, but produces an incorrect solution

## Runtime Error

A program's syntax is correct but the program attempts an impossible operation

Examples: 
- dividing by zero 
- multiplying strings together

A runtime error halts the execution of the program. Abrupt and unintended termination of a program is often called a crash of the program
