# Troubleshooting


### We just talked about debugging... how is this any different?

> **Troubleshooting**: a systematic process for finding and fixing a problems cause in a system

This definition is nearly identical to the one we just gave for debugging.
Really, the only difference is TECHNICALLY, debugging normally refers
to code, while troubleshooting refers to systems at large.

Along with this, the book defines some extra features about a *proper* 
troubleshooting set of techniques.

OTHERWISE THOUGH, both troubleshooting and debugging are often used interchangeable!
