# AI

This is going to be very brief overview of AI.

There has been lots of news about of AI recently, and specifically, the hype and sometimes fear around it.

Should you be afraid... no

Should you be afraid of you losing your job to AI... probably not (Maybe talk about Devin)

Should you trust AI... not exactly

So how should you feel about AI? Think of it as a tool, cause that is what it is.
If people use that tool in a bad way, that sucks, but it certainly has good uses as long as the tool is used correctly.

## What is AI

Essentially, an AI program will try to predict what its next move is going to be depending on what came before it.

Now you can find instances of AI all over the place online:
- AI being used to generate images and videos for you
- AI being used to complete video game
- AI being used in autonomous vehicles
- AI being used in research
- **AND AI being use for language models**

## ChatGPT

An example of one of these large language models is [ChatGPT by OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/)

Now we are talking about ChatGPT for two reasons:
- It is a good example showing off how AI works
  - Give it prompt -> gets 'predicted' result
  - Learns from you as you input data
    - Tell it to only speak in rhymes

- Second reason we are talking about it: **It can generate code**
  - If you give a prompt and tell it to write it in python, it will 'attempt' to do that
    - Show 'Example 1'
    - This does 'work'
  - But, there are a few problems with using AI for code
    - Since it just 'predicting the next text', it can often miss the greater context as to what is trying to be 
      accomplished by your code. 
    - The code data it has in its data set is just bad code
    - Sometimes, it just makes up libraries that it says you should import, but they simply do not exist
    - If you just copy and paste the code, you now lack understanding on what the code you are running does
      and if it works properly
    - It doesn't automatically verify if there are bugs in the code
    - Lacks security concerns and generated code has been KNOWN to create flawed code which leaves software/companies vulnerable to attacks
  - So, how should AI be used for coding
    - If you are struggling with a particular section of code, maybe ask an AI to generate it, try to understand
      the code it wrote (and if it looks good for your use case), and either use it or base the code you write off of it
    - Don't depend on it! Again, this can't be stressed, AI is a tool which can used alongside
      actual development, but it can often make mistakes and if you put bad code in a project, that will be considered your fault

For the sake of the class:
  - IF YOU ARE JUST COPYING AND PASTING AI GENERATED CODE, IT REALLY DOESN'T HELP YOU LEARN.
  - Writing code is a massive part of actually learning how it works.
  - Obviously, you are allowed to use it as a tool as discussed above, but I cannot stress enough that you SHOULD NOT RELY ON IT

## Final words: 

As a software engineer, a huge part of your job is communicating with whoever is wanting your product.
AI is not really equipped to communicate as it needs to, as in it can't reach out to find out HOW
the owners of a product want a software to run (depending on their needs), or communicating like
pros and cons to said owner and asking which way they would like it.
