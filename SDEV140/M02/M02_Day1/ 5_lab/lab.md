> Write a program that accepts the lengths of three sides of a triangle as inputs. Ths program should indicate whether the triangle is an equilateral triangle or not

```python
side1 = float(input("Please input the length of the first side"))
side2 = float(input("Please input the length of the first side"))
side3 = float(input("Please input the length of the first side"))

if side1 == side2 and side2 == side3:
    print("This is an equilateral triangle")
