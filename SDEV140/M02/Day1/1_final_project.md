# Final Project

The Final Project Is not really a "project" per se,
instead it is a collection of labs done throughout the course to show you have an understanding over the course's 
material.

Most of the information can be found here:

The Assignments themselves can be found here:

You really should work on these throughout the course, although during the last week, this is the only book-related
assignment due, so "technically" you could finish it all up then, but the final and a pretty large project are also due,
so maybe do this sooner rather than later!
