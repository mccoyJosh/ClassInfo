# Pass

Sometimes, you don't want to do anything with your code
maybe there's a section of code you want to wait to do but need something
in the loop to run the code, or actually don't want to do anything in a section of code:
THEN USE, pass

```python
x = int(input('Enter a number: '))

if x == 0:
    pass  # does nothing
```

Now, you can work on the rest of the code and come back to this if statement
