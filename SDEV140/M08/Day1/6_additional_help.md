# Additional Help

Many things in the examples shown before are pretty BADLY implemented and there are many smart
ways to go about it... so do not think this is the end all be all of how to create things in games.
For instance, if we were to be creating an actual game, we would want to use FAR more classes to
help reduce waste of time when creating more of the same resources down the road... but this is not
really an issue due to how many resources we are using (NOT ALOT).


This is just a simple example of working with pygame's code and creating something pretty simple. 


For far more help in creating games, check out pygame's official documentation about using the
game engine along with examples/videos online talking about best practices.

Also do note that the style of game is going to change how you are going to design and implement
specific features. For instance, if this was a 2d platformer, we would want to implement our
movement entirely different compare to what we are doing in the previous examples.

# The actual Assignment

The assignment we have for this class does not actually have start off from scratch and make a 
full game, instead it gives you a starting points and asks you to add on to it.

This is far more doable and hopefully from today you have a better idea at what you are looking at!
