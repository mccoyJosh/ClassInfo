## Shipping Out Code before it is done

- Think of AAA Game Studios who are constantly releasing unfinished games
  - Pros and cons of hey, people are going to be mad about the game, BUT, maybe the studio needs funding to finish the game and releasing the game early would allow that.
  - Comes down to being honest and open concerning development. Like, people would not be as mad if the game released early if it was not full price and if it was explicitly said it was not finished.
