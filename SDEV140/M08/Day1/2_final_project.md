# Final Project

We have already discussed this, but now that it is due soon, we are going to
quickly re-talk about it. 


This is not a traditional project, but instead a collection of labs which should show you 
can write code for a number of different situations.

So, still a cumulative work, but very specifically testing you in these areas.


Hopefully you have been working on these assignments up to this point, but if not, PLEASE MAKE SURE TO GET TO WORK:

This assignment consists of 
- 17 Labs
- 20% of your grade

Not doing this would be horrible for your grade.

They can be located in the textbook.

PLEASE REACH OUT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS!
